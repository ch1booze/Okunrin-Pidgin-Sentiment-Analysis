    ## What is Sentiment Analysis?

    **Sentiment analysis** is the process of analyzing large volumes of text to determine whether it expresses a:

    - Positive sentiment 😊
    - Negative sentiment 😔
    - Neutral sentiment 😐

    This technique allows us to *automatically understand the emotional tone in text*,

    Our sentiment analysis model is trained on a dataset of tweets in Nigerian Pidgin. Here are some key characteristics of the dataset:

    - **Source**: Tweets collected from Twitter
    - **Language**: Nigerian Pidgin
    - **Size**: Approximately 10,000 labeled tweets
    - **Labels**: Each tweet is labeled as positive, negative, or neutral
    - **Time Range**: Tweets collected between January 2022 and December 2023
    - **Topics**: Diverse range including politics, entertainment, sports, and daily life

    This dataset provides a rich source of real-world Pidgin language usage, allowing our models to capture the nuances and expressions unique to Nigerian Pidgin.

    The rule-based method uses a predefined set of rules and a lexicon (dictionary) of words associated with different sentiments.

    - **How it works**: It searches for specific words or phrases in the text and assigns sentiments based on these predefined rules.
    - **Advantages**: Simple to implement and understand; works well for straightforward expressions.
    - **Limitations**: May struggle with context, sarcasm, or complex sentences; requires manual creation and updating of rules.

    The pretrained method uses a model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data, which is then applied to our Pidgin sentiment analysis task.

    - **How it works**: It uses transfer learning, applying knowledge from a model trained on a large dataset (often in English) to our specific Pidgin task.
    - **Advantages**: Can capture complex language patterns; doesn't require a large Pidgin-specific dataset.
    - **Limitations**: May not fully capture Pidgin-specific nuances; performance depends on the similarity between the pretraining data and Pidgin.

    The finetuned method starts with a pretrained model and further trains it on our Pidgin-specific dataset.

    - **How it works**: It takes a pretrained model and adjusts its parameters using our labeled Pidgin tweets.
    - **Advantages**: Combines the benefits of pretraining with Pidgin-specific learning; often achieves the best performance.
    - **Limitations**: Requires a good amount of labeled Pidgin data; can be computationally intensive.
